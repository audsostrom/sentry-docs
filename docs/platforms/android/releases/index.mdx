This SDK uses the following ways to release SDK updates:

## `Pre-release`

We create pre-releases (alpha, beta, RC,â€¦) for larger and potentially more impactful changes, such as new features or major versions.

## `Latest`

We continuously release major/minor/hotfix versions from the `main` branch. These releases go through all our internal quality gates and are very safe to use and intended to be the default for most teams.

## `Stable`

We promote releases from `Latest` when they have been used in the field for some time and in scale, considering time since release, adoption, and other quality and stability metrics. These releases will be indicated on the releases page (https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/) with the `Stable` suffix.

## FAQ

### Where can I find the latest stable release for any given SDK?

On the releases pages of the SDK's GitHub repo. Stable releases will be indicated with the suffix `(Stable)` in the name of the release. You can also use the search box in the top right, and you will see the newest matching releases.

### Does this mean our other releases are not stable?

No. Stability and performance are the top priorities for every release. The `Stable` release channel is specifically designed as an additional way to build on that by utilising the fact that releases are proven in the wild an in large scale.

### How often do we mark SDKs as stable?

The target cadence is to provide monthly stable releases.

### Should every customer only use stable releases?

Every developer, team and company knows best which release channel works for them. As stated earlier, every release is considered stable, but `Stable` releases provide an extra layer of safety to make sure the SDK is working as expected, with the tradeoff of a slightly delayed availability. This is also the reason why it's there isn't a pre-release for every release.

### How does this relate to the release process and stability of a feature?

This process is independent of stability of an individual feature and does not change the way features are rolled out. For example, a stable SDK release might still include a new feature that is marked experimental.
